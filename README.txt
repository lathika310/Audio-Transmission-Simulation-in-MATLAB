This is the final lab for the "ELE532 Signals and Systems I" 5th semester course for the
Bachelors in Computer Engineering Undergraduate Degree at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly known as Ryerson). Completed Dec. 3rd 2023.

The final part of the project is the simulated singal transmission. 
The code is implemented in the B1.m matlab script file.
Running the script performs the mathematical simulations and plays the recovered audio transmission.
You may read more in the Lab4_Report.pdf file.

You may also need to install MATLAB plugins to run the script, 
and a version of MATLAB newer than R2023a.
